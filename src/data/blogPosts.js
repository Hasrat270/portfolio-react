        Building scalable REST APIs is a crucial skill for any MERN stack developer. In this comprehensive guide, 
        I'll walk you through creating production-ready APIs that demonstrate your expertise to potential employers.
      </p>
      <p>
        REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs have become the standard for web services. As a MERN stack 
        developer, understanding how to design and implement scalable APIs is essential. This article covers everything 
        from basic routing to advanced patterns that showcase your technical depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll explore Express.js middleware, error handling strategies, request validation, and security best practices. 
        These skills directly translate to real-world projects and demonstrate your ability to build maintainable, 
        production-grade applications.
